## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Figuring out how to code the line break in CSS with the hr tag and how to style it with CSS.
- Learning how to use the marker tag in order to make the ordered list numbers the color brown. 
- Also deciding between using a table or a div tag for the last section. I tried out the div using p tags and hr for the line breaks, but I also had to put a different class for each span and put a different margin value but I felt like there had to be an easier way.
- I switched to using table and ran into the problem of border-bottom because it showed up underneat the fat 22g column while it wasn't there in the design. had to add a class to the last td tr and added border: none;

### Useful resources
